# Structure

Pizza-back is the backend, pizza-front is the front end.
CD into both in two separate terminals, run npm install to acquire all reqs.

Then run npm start on both the front and backend to have both up and running.
They both can run separately, but functionality will obviously not work for the front to talk to the back
if both aren't up.


# Concurrent (thanks concurrent) Run
If all modules are installed, can run 'npm run dev' from the default folder to have both simultaneously up.


## Notes:

This will require mongoDB to be installed in order to work. 
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/ - simply installing this and having it run should be enough for the backend to work.

In addition, npm will obviously be needed and installed.
